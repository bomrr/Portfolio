BinaryTree Folder:
A binary tree is a hierarchical data sctructure that contains nodes, each node with two child nodes. Each child node is referred to as the left and the right node, each containing a value.

If the number the program is looking for is less than the value in the node, move to the left (lesser value) node. If the program is looking for a number greater than the value in the current node, move to the right. This can also be used for adding digits.

ListQueueStack Folder:
This folder showcases a a stack and a queue using a linked list. The linked list simply creates a node and adds it to the beginning or the end of the list, while having markers to remember the positions of the 'head' and 'tail' of the string of nodes.

The queue is a type of data structure that adds nodes to the end of the list, and dequeues them from the head.

The stack is a data structure that places each added value on top of the previous one, and allows for reading the stack by 'popping' the top one off of the stack.
